## Takeaways

This application was created using test driven development with Mocha framework and Chai testing library. I was given a spec with prompts to make a working application using modular, reusable code that follows Single Responsibility Principle. This was my frist time implementing test driven development, which was challenging and time consuming; however, it forced me to be more intential with my approach and avoid any bugs once created. This project was also challenging using many different objects to create the application, which helped sharpen my object oriented programming skills.
